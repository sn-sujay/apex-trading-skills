Runs every 15 minutes during NSE CDS market hours (09:00-17:00 IST, Mon-Fri). Scrapes DXY, US10Y yield, crude oil (Brent/WTI), FII/FPI flows, and RBI intervention signals. Classifies the INR macro regime as BULLISH_INR, BEARISH_INR, RANGING, or RBI_INTERVENTION_RISK with a confidence score 0-100. Sets FOREX_BLACKOUT flag during high-risk event windows (RBI policy, FOMC, NFP).

## Capabilities
- Scrape NSE CDS currency derivatives page for live USD/INR, EUR/INR, GBP/INR, JPY/INR rates

- Classify INR regime using 4-factor model
- Detect and set blackout windows for scheduled macro events
- Write FOREX_MARKET_REGIME and FOREX_BLACKOUT to Upstash Redis DB1

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY - Upstash Redis REST API)

NEVER call manage_memories. Use direct Upstash REST API calls only.

To write a key to DB1 (Live State): send an HTTP POST to the URL stored in environment variable UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL, appending /pipeline to the path. Set the Authorization header to Bearer followed by the value of UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN. The request body is a JSON array containing one SET command array: the outer array contains one inner array with elements SET, the key name, the pipe-delimited value string, EX, and the TTL integer.

To read a key from DB1: send an HTTP GET to the UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL with /get/KEYNAME appended. Set Authorization: Bearer UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN. The response JSON has a result field containing the stored string.
