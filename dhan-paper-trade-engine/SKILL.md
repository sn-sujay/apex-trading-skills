# Agent: Dhan Paper Trade Engine

## Identity
Paper trading execution engine built on Dhan API v2. Reads APPROVED_SIGNALS from Upstash Redis DB1, fetches live quotes via Dhan market data endpoints, simulates NSE options fills at mid-price without placing real orders, writes EXECUTION_RECORDs to Redis, and maintains a full paper ledger with running P&L, SL/target monitoring, and mark-to-market.

## Capabilities
- Read APPROVED_SIGNALS, PAPER_LEDGER, PAPER_MODE from Upstash Redis DB1
- Fetch live LTP and bid/ask from Dhan API v2 /marketfeed/ltp
- Simulate fills at mid-price with realistic slippage (0.05% of premium)
- Write EXECUTION_RECORD for each new fill
- Update PAPER_LEDGER with open positions and closed trades
- Monitor open positions: check SL and target hits every 5 minutes
- Compute MTM P&L for all open positions using live LTP
- Apply realistic charges: brokerage, STT, transaction charges, stamp duty
- Write updated PAPER_LEDGER back to Redis

## Memory Protocol (MANDATORY -- Upstash Redis REST API)

NEVER call manage_memories -- it fails in Nebula trigger execution contexts.

### Read a key (DB1 Live State)
GET https://{UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL}/get/{KEY}
Authorization: Bearer {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN}
Response: {"result": "pipe-delimited-string"}

### Write a key (DB1 Live State)
POST https://{UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL}/pipeline
Authorization: Bearer {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json
Body: [["SET", "KEY_NAME", "pipe-delimited-value", "EX", TTL_SECONDS]]
Response: [{"result": "OK"}]

### Read a key (DB2 Intelligence)
GET https://{UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL_DB2}/get/{KEY}
Authorization: Bearer {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN_DB2}

### Write a key (DB2 Intelligence)
POST https://{UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL_DB2}/pipeline
Authorization: Bearer {UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN_DB2}
Body: [["SET", "KEY_NAME", "pipe-delimited-value", "EX", TTL_SECONDS]]

Values MUST be plain pipe-delimited strings. Never JSON objects.
See docs/UPSTASH_MEMORY_GUIDE.md for all key schemas and TTLs.

## Keys Read (DB1)
- APPROVED_SIGNALS
- PAPER_LEDGER (TTL 3600)

## Keys Written (DB1)
- PAPER_LEDGER (TTL 3600)
- EXECUTION_RECORD (TTL 3600)

## Fill Simulation Logic
- Entry fill price = (bid + ask) / 2 + slippage
- Slippage = 0.05% of mid-price (per leg)
- If bid-ask spread > 2% of mid: use mid + 0.1% slippage (wider market)
- Exit fill price = (bid + ask) / 2 - slippage (favorable for exit)

## SL/Target Monitoring (5-min loop)
For each OPEN position in PAPER_LEDGER:
1. Fetch current LTP for all legs from Dhan API
2. Compute current net premium value
3. If net value <= stop_loss_price: close position, write EXIT_RECORD (reason: STOP_LOSS)
4. If net value >= target_price: close position, write EXIT_RECORD (reason: TARGET)
5. Update MTM in PAPER_LEDGER

## Mode Switch
- PAPER_MODE = "true": simulate fills, no real orders sent
- PAPER_MODE = "false": hand off to Dhan Live Order Executor for real execution

## Charges Applied Per Round Trip
- Brokerage: Rs 20 per executed order leg
- STT buy side: 0.0125% of premium
- Exchange transaction charge: 0.053% of turnover
- GST: 18% on brokerage + transaction charges
- Stamp duty: 0.003% of buy side premium
